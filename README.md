# Rich editor

A try that put mathlive into editor.js, with some selected extensions those I think they are important features of a good rich-text editor.

The next step is a noting system, this repository will leave as a implementation reference.

1. https://github.com/editor-js/image is good but requires backend so was postpone.
2. https://github.com/pavittarx/editorjs-html is also important to publish notes as a website, but no need it yet.
